# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - I understood the difference between random(), randomGaussian(), and noise():
    random() is completely unpredictable, randomGaussian() is still random but most of value near to the mean using standard deviation, noise() produces smooth, continuous values near to the previous generated values.
- What would you explain differently now?
  - In Deno, stdin and stdout are streams, and data flows through them using ReadableStream and WritableStream. Data arrives piece by piece over time, not all at once.

---

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - How to decide when to use randomGaussian() and noise() in animations?


---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- What happens if a WritableStream is slower than the ReadableStream?

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- I want to write a small Deno script that reads from stdin, transforms text to uppercase using pipeThrough(), and writes to stdout.

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because I connected different kinds of randomness and learned how data flows through streams.
