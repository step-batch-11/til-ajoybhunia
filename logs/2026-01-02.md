# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- Today I understood vector in a different way, that vector is not just about 2d
  or 3d spaces, It represents the dimensions of data like different attributes
  of data like an object.
- I thought that shell is just a program to run commands but it is a scripting
  language with conditions, loops and functions also.
- Command means a single instruction, besides script means a set of
  instructions.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- I didn't understand properly about ln (link) like how will it build link with config files.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- What is vector dot and cross product? And what are the uses of these operations?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because I learnt a lot of things. And also learnt that remembering things like what I'm doing now is pretty good for memorizing stuff. I didn't have this habbit but but I understood that it's really effective for learning and it is hard too. In the place of 15 minutes I took more than one and half hours to structure things to put it here. Above all this is a great experience.
