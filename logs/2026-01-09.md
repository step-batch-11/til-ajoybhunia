# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- `.read()` reads data from a file into a buffer. It returns the number of bytes
  read or null if end of file (EOF) is reached.
- `.write()` writes data from a buffer into a file. It returns the number of
  bytes written.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- What feels fragile in your understanding?

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- When I tried to read text from one TTY using Deno.open() and write it to
  another TTY, each entered character was printed alternately on different TTYs.
  What is the reason behind this behavior?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- I want to implement parser using a class.

# One-Sentence Summary
